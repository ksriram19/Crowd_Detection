# Crowd Detection in Video and Live Webcam Feeds

This project employs YOLOv5 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking to detect and track people in both video files and live webcam feeds. It features real-time crowd detection and tracking through live webcam feeds, as well as the ability to upload and process video files to detect and track people throughout the video duration.

Utilizing YOLOv5 for object detection ensures accurate identification of people within frames, while DeepSORT facilitates robust tracking by associating detections with existing tracks and maintaining identities across frames. 

The system provides visualizations with bounding boxes and labels to highlight detected people, along with crowd density insights by counting the number of people detected. Contributions are welcome for further enhancements or optimizations to the system, and it is licensed under the MIT License.
