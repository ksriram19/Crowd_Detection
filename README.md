# Crowd Detection in Video and Live Webcam Feeds

This project utilizes YOLOv5 for object detection and DeepSORT for tracking to detect and track people in both video files and live webcam feeds.

<b><u>Features</b></u>:

Live Webcam Feed: 
Real-time detection and tracking of people in live webcam feeds.
Video Processing: Upload and process video files to detect and track people throughout the video.

Object Detection: 
Utilizes YOLOv5 to detect people in frames.
Tracking: DeepSORT tracks detected people across frames, maintaining identities.

Visualization: Bounding boxes and labels highlight detected people for easy visualization.
Counting: Provides crowd density insights by counting detected people.

Technologies: Flask, OpenCV, PyTorch, DeepSORT, Ultralytics YOLO.

Usage: Clone repository, install dependencies, run Flask app (app.py), access web app, explore live feed and video processing.

Contributions: Contributions welcome for features, bug fixes, and optimizations.
